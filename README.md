## Requirement
Make a horizontal calendar component (dates stripe) that can display days of one week and can be navigated back/forth.
- The component should be nicely designed, be easy and intuitive to use.
- The component should support setting custom day display, active/selected day, and have today highlighted.

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Experience
I really enjoy the process of creating the Calendar using React with the given requirements. Although the task 
was quite straight forward, there are a few considerations need to be considered
during the developments. For example, how the Calendar components should be structured and how to apply SOLID principle
developing the calendar components.
